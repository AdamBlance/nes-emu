## Summary

A cycle-accurate NES emulator written in Rust ü¶Ä with an [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) frontend. 
Cycle-accuracy in this context means that the hardware is emulated one CPU cycle at a time (rather than one CPU instruction at a time). 
This supports the emulation of games that depend on hardware quirks (open bus behaviour, dummy reads, tight interrupt timings) without relying on game-specific hacks.

## Features
- Cycle-accurate emulation with full audio/video support (CPU, PPU and APU implemented)
- Controller support with configurable button mappings
- "Rewind" save-state feature (shown below ‚¨áÔ∏è)
- Adjustable emulation speed
- CPU debugger (in development)

## Supported Games
Games with any of the following mappers are supported. This covers over 1000 NES games.
- [iNES mapper 0 / NROM](https://nesdir.github.io/mapper0.html)
- [iNES mapper 1 / MMC1](https://nesdir.github.io/mapper1.html)
- [iNES mapper 2 / UxROM](https://nesdir.github.io/mapper2.html)
- [iNES mapper 3 / CNROM](https://nesdir.github.io/mapper3.html)
- [iNES mapper 4 / MMC3](https://nesdir.github.io/mapper4.html)
- [iNES mapper 7 / AxROM](https://nesdir.github.io/mapper7.html)

A handful of games are known to not work (one of which is Battletoads) due to a bug in my sprite 0 hit detection.

## Installation
Compiled binaries aren't yet available, so you must build from source.
First install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you haven't already.

    git clone https://github.com/AdamBlance/nes-emu.git
    cd nes-emu
    cargo build --release

A specific version of Rust nightly (as defined in `rust-toolchain.toml`) should be automatically installed when attempting to build (as the emulator depends on unstable features). 

Run with `cargo run --release`. Note that without the `--release` flag the emulator will not perform well.

If the emulator is struggling to keep up, try uncommenting the following lines in `Cargo.toml` and building again. 

    [profile.release]
    lto = "fat"
    codegen-units = 1

The compilation will take a long time but this should yield a binary that performs better.
