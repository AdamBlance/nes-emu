LDA MEM[ ZP[AB,+1] + Y(06) = 89AB ]

Attributes:
 - What's in memory there (right at the end)
 - What's the value of that register


Columns should be like this

Address of instruction
Instruction
Value being used (either immediate or read from memory)

Address value was retrieved from
So maybe this could be shown like
89B1 = 89AB + Y(06)
