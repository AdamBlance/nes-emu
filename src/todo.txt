High priority:
    - Refinement of PPU and CPU before moving on 
        + Make sure that CPU passes most tests, NMI, timing, etc
        + Make sure that PPU passes most tests, sprite zero, NMI
        + Sprite 0 2 cycle rendering delay
    - Refactor APU
        + Break APU down into units

Low priority: 
    - Implement all unofficial instructions
    - Make APU and OAM DMA suspend CPU for correct number of cycles
