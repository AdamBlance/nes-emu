High priority:
    - IT'S TIME TO WRITE A PROPPER DEBUGGER!!!
    - Implement all unofficial instructions. Most test roms test these, might as well implement them.
        + This will involve putting associated functions in the
    - Implement a decent debugger! Will need this to figure out why tests aren't passing.
    - Implement mapper 3, most of Blargg's tests use that
    - Refinement of PPU and CPU before moving on 
        + Make sure that CPU passes most tests, NMI, timing, etc
        + Make sure that PPU passes most tests, sprite zero, NMI
        + Sprite 0 2 cycle rendering delay
    - Refactor APU
        + Break APU down into units

Low priority: 
    - Make APU and OAM DMA suspend CPU for correct number of cycles



look into open bus behaviour? with ppu
