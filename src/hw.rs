So I think I know how to do the sound

The nes generates sound at a sample rate of 44100Hz apparently

that means the digital to analogue converter inside the nes samples the waveforms generated from
the apu 44,100 times every second

the problem is, the NES code runs way faster than the actual NES does, so any samples generated
would have to be placed in a ring buffer, I guess

Even then, there is the problem of timing. If the code produces even one less sample than it should
have at any point (for whatever reason), the buffer will empty, or will get full over time 

floating point errors or anything could cause something like that to happen over time

Audio will always be read at exactly 44100Hz, which is guaranteed by the operating system and all
that low level stuff, probably driven by hardware interrupts and stuff



There are a couple ways I can think of to guarantee that samples are provided at the right rate

The first is to drive the emulator directly from the sound library
For example, the Rust rodio crate has a Source trait that lets you write your own sound sources

A struct that implements the Source trait must implement Iterator

This iterator is used to get the next sample at the required rate

Iterator objects must implement the "next" method that returns the next sample

The next method could run the emulation for the right number of cycles to produce the next sample

Only thing is that might look a bit weird, since the emulator will start running after the call to 

OutputStream::play_raw(nes_audio)


One other way, which is probably what I'll go for, is to do something like this person did:
https://ltriant.github.io/2019/11/22/nes-emulator.html

coincidentally, they used rust also!

Basically, have the emulator produce samples into a buffer

If the buffer ever gets nearly empty or nearly full, do something about it
Not sure exactly what they did, but maybe just don't put the next sample in the buffer
This might happen every 10000 cycles or something, so will probably not be noticable 


To produce samples at the correct rate, could probably just look at the CPU clock count

CPU runs at ~1,789,773 Hz 

Sample rate is ~44,100Hz


1,789,773 / 44,100 = 40.584421768707486

So approx every 40.6 cpu cycles, generate a sample from the APU
just need an averaging thing

like, do first one at 40 cycles

then, how many cycles since last sample? 

if average cycles since last sample is closer to 40.6 than the average cycles since last sample 
including this cpu cycle, get sample

then it will just naturally converge to 40.584421768707486, executing either 40 or 41 cycles 
depending on what's going on

don't make the buffer too big, or sound will get desynced

if the buffer is getting too full over time because we're just slightly faster than we should be,
just don't push a sample to the buffer that time, it's just one sample I'm sure it'll be impossible
to notice

If the buffer is getting close to being empty, like one or two samples in there, add 
two of the same sample when pushing to the buffer

This should be mostly fine honestly. If we average at 40.blahblahblah cycles, then it should pretty
closely match the 44,100Hz sample rate.

sound is too hard, going to improve the cpu and ppu for now? 
yeah, will try to get mario running first
so sprite 0 hit flag and one byte delay when reading ppudata need to be implemented

APU NOTES

Two square wave channels
One triangle wave channel
One noise channel
One sample channel


a divider outputs a clock every n input clocks, where n is the dividers period
internally, this is just a counter that gets decremented by the input clock until it hits 0
then the value n is reloaded




frame conuter

so there's this thing called the frame counter (nothing to do with video frames) that has a divider
it divides the master clock to produce a 240Hz clock (that I think can be used by channels)

in the frame counter, there is also a sequencer, which I think is like a selector in 
little big planet? 

the sequencer is not controlled by the 240Hz clock! the sequencer is clocked every second CPU cycle

there is some counter in the sequencer that counts how many apu cycles have passed (1 apu = 2 cpu)

once the count has reached some value, the sequencer advances and the count resets

the sequencer will "clock" envelopes, sweep units, length counters and all that stuff
once that step in the sequencer is reached, those things happen


    f = set interrupt flag
    l = clock length counters and sweep units
    e = clock envelopes and triangle's linear counter

mode 0: 4-step  effective rate (approx)
---------------------------------------
    - - - f      60 Hz
    - l - l     120 Hz
    e e e e     240 Hz

mode 1: 5-step  effective rate (approx)
---------------------------------------
    - - - - -   (interrupt flag never set)
    l - l - -    96 Hz
    e e e e -   192 Hz

right so the 240Hz clock does clock the sequencer!
I guess? I suppose the exact reason doesn't matter



most channels have a "length counter", which will store a number and count down
when the counter reaches zero, the channel will be muted

all channels have a bit that says whether they will stop when the counter reaches zero


Square wave channels

square waves have a duty cycle that can be modified
two bits in the i/o register can change this

there is a constant volume bit, which determines whether the volume is constant, or controlled
by an envelope

an envelope is like, a changing value? So like EEeeeeeuuuuoooooommmmmm â†“

if volume is constant, the volume is stored in 4 bits

there is a bit to enable and disable sweep




right so there's envelope which is volume
there's sweep which is pitch (period)
duty cycle, which changes timbre

there are also length counters, which is clocked by the frame thing
these stop the sound when the counter is 0, setting a length for the note basically
