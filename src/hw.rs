/*

sound is too hard, going to improve the cpu and ppu for now? 
yeah, will try to get mario running first
so sprite 0 hit flag and one byte delay when reading ppudata need to be implemented

APU NOTES

Two square wave channels
One triangle wave channel
One noise channel
One sample channel


a divider outputs a clock every n input clocks, where n is the dividers period
internally, this is just a counter that gets decremented by the input clock until it hits 0
then the value n is reloaded




frame conuter

so there's this thing called the frame counter (nothing to do with video frames) that has a divider
it divides the master clock to produce a 240Hz clock (that I think can be used by channels)

in the frame counter, there is also a sequencer, which I think is like a selector in 
little big planet? 

the sequencer is not controlled by the 240Hz clock! the sequencer is clocked every second CPU cycle

there is some counter in the sequencer that counts how many apu cycles have passed (1 apu = 2 cpu)

once the count has reached some value, the sequencer advances and the count resets

the sequencer will "clock" envelopes, sweep units, length counters and all that stuff
once that step in the sequencer is reached, those things happen


    f = set interrupt flag
    l = clock length counters and sweep units
    e = clock envelopes and triangle's linear counter

mode 0: 4-step  effective rate (approx)
---------------------------------------
    - - - f      60 Hz
    - l - l     120 Hz
    e e e e     240 Hz

mode 1: 5-step  effective rate (approx)
---------------------------------------
    - - - - -   (interrupt flag never set)
    l - l - -    96 Hz
    e e e e -   192 Hz

right so the 240Hz clock does clock the sequencer!
I guess? I suppose the exact reason doesn't matter



most channels have a "length counter", which will store a number and count down
when the counter reaches zero, the channel will be muted

all channels have a bit that says whether they will stop when the counter reaches zero


Square wave channels

square waves have a duty cycle that can be modified
two bits in the i/o register can change this

there is a constant volume bit, which determines whether the volume is constant, or controlled
by an envelope

an envelope is like, a changing value? So like EEeeeeeuuuuoooooommmmmm â†“

if volume is constant, the volume is stored in 4 bits

there is a bit to enable and disable sweep




right so there's envelope which is volume
there's sweep which is pitch (period)
duty cycle, which changes timbre

there are also length counters, which is clocked by the frame thing
these stop the sound when the counter is 0, setting a length for the note basically
